Difference between a Library and Framework?
  -Frameworks and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
  -When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework,    the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
